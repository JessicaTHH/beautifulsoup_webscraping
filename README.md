# beautifulsoup_webscrapping
Web scrapping with python package beautiful soup. Collect data from live website, and write into CSV files.

## About this project:
Since I'm used to working with excel spreadsheets, often when I collect data, I will need to copy it from live websites then paste it onto excel, spending hours collecting data.
Finally, I find this web-scraping technique online and tried to collect a few lists, and it worked! So here is one of the data lists I've created, it's a list of the top 100 movies to watch.
