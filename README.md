# beautifulsoup_webscraping
Web scraping with python package beautiful soup. Collect data from live website, and write into CSV files.


## About this project:
Since I'm used to working with excel spreadsheets, often when I collect data, I will need to copy it from live websites then paste it onto excel, spending hours collecting data.
Finally, I find this web-scraping technique online and tried to collect a few lists, and it worked! I will no longer need to copy-paste, all I need to do is write some lines, and voila! 
So here is one of the data lists I've created, it's a list of the top 100 movies to watch. 


## About the directories:
There are only 2 files in this folder:
- Main.py includes the code of...
  - send requests and get data from the live website.
  - select the parts I need from the website.
  - write the data into a CSV file.
- top100mustwatchmovies.csv is the final result exported from the code.



Hope you enjoy the convenience technologies bring to life as I did! Tzu, Apr.18 2022
